# Telco-Churn-Prediction

It is always vital to prevent customers to turnover. Therefore, churn Prediction is crucially important as it may relates to the survival of a company. By looking thoroughly to the dataset, we may some intuition on specific groups of customer tend to have a higher churning rate. In this project, we will use Telco Company Dataset to build our churn prediction investigator.

### Step by Step workflow
| Step  | Workflow  |  Content   |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1     | EDA       |<br>1. Looking for missing values <br>2. See if there is any outliers <br>3. Distribution of Churning Rate due to different features <br>4. Remove unused columns|
| 2     |  Data Preprocessing      |<br>1. Feature Scaling <br>2. Encoding <br>3. Dealing with imbalanced dataset|
| 3     |Model Training| <br>1. Logistic Regression <br>2. Random Forest <br>3. KNN <br>4. XGBoost |
| 4     | Feature Importance evaluation| Permutation Feature Importance|
| 5     | Recommendation|<br> 1. Service Charges <br>Whether they fine tune the price or offer discounts/bundle_price in a long term contract <br>2. Connection Stability of Service <br>They should review the connection stability of internet service espically for users connecting via optic fibre. <br>3. Choice of Streaming Channel <br>Reviewing the selection/choices of both Streaming TV and Movies seems to be one of the directions to think of. They may also give special offers to those in pairs having lower price to watch Streaming TV/Movies. |
